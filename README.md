# TechEd Week 6 Assignment

## Project Overview

This project is a cookie-clicker-style web application where users can earn cookies and purchase upgrades to increase their cookies per second. The application uses React for the front-end and Express.js for the back-end API to serve upgrade data. It incorporates `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for state management and real-time updates, and the game automatically updates the user's progress every second.

## Features

- **Automatic Game Updates**: The application automatically updates the game state every second, showing real-time progress of earned cookies.
- **Upgrades System**: Users can purchase upgrades using cookies to increase their cookies per second (CPS). The upgrades are displayed dynamically using the `.map()` function.
- **Dynamic Rendering with React**: The app uses React components to maintain separation of concerns and keep the code organized and maintainable.
- **API Integration**: The app fetches upgrade data from an Express.js API that serves upgrade details.
- **Real-time Notifications**: The app notifies users when they cannot afford an upgrade or when they successfully purchase one.

## User Stories

### 🐿️ Developer User Stories:

- **useState Hook**: Manage the user’s interactions and state changes smoothly.
- **useEffect Hook**: Implement `setInterval` to manage the game time efficiently, ensuring real-time updates.
- **Component Organization**: Use separate files for each component to improve code organization.
- **Dynamic Rendering with `.map()`**: Render upgrade lists efficiently using `.map()`.

### 🐿️ User Stories:

- **Real-time Game Updates**: Users can see their progress and earned cookies update every second.
- **Upgrades**: Users can purchase upgrades to increase their cookies per second (CPS).

## Requirements

### 🎯 Core Requirements Achieved:

- **useState Hook**: Used to manage the current number of cookies, CPS, and upgrades.
- **useEffect Hook**: Used to manage the game's timer and periodically update the cookies.
- **Componentization**: The project is broken into multiple components such as `UpgradeList`, `Upgrade`, `NotifyUser`, and more, ensuring that the code is modular and easy to maintain.
- **Dynamic Lists with `.map()`**: The upgrades are displayed using the `.map()` function, ensuring efficient rendering.
- **Upgrade Purchase Logic**: The app includes logic for handling the purchase of upgrades, deducting cookies, and increasing CPS.

## Stretch Goals

### 🏹 Achieved:

- **API Integration**: The application fetches upgrade information from an external API (the Express server) and dynamically updates the front-end with this data.
- **Local Storage**: The application Saves and retrieves game data () to preserve user progress across sessions.

### 🏹 Achieved?:

- **Styling**: Improve the UI to create a more visually appealing experience for users.

## Reflection

### 🎯 Requirements Achieved:

- Successfully implemented the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.
- Real-time game updates with `setInterval` in `useEffect`.
- Cleanly separated components and used `.map()` for dynamic rendering.
- Integrated the back-end API for upgrades.

### 🎯 Challenges:

- Handling the re-rendering of notifications when the same message was triggered required several refinements to the `NotifyUser` component logic.

### 🏹 Stretch Goals:

- Used custom Upgrades API to manage upgrades dynamically from the server.
